# Introduction
We will be creating a Canary to test this simple user submission form - http://addressupdater-2049029495.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ 

Navigate to the link, enter random text in firstname, lastname and address fields. Click on **Update address** button. Repeat it a few times and you will observe that the page randomly says *Unable to update address* which we consider as failure. Our goal is to create a Canary that will identify the failure scenarios and record results automatically.
